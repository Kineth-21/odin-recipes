        Instructions
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make buttermilk, combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set it aside for 5 minutes to sour the milk.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into buttermilk mixture until well combined; add flour mixture and whisk until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. The pancake batter will be thick. Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip the pancake and cook until brown on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Repeat step 5 with remaing batter.</li>
    </ol>
